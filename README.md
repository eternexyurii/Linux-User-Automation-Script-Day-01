# Linux User Automation Script – Day 01

This is my first GitHub project! A Bash script to automate user and group management in Linux.

## Features

- Creates users: `user1`
- Adds `user1` to the `sudo` group

## Prerequisites

- Linux system
- `sudo` privileges

## Usage

1. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x main.sh
Run the script:

sudo ./main.sh


The script will check if users and group already exist to avoid errors.

Notes

Designed to help beginners practice Linux user and group management.

Can be extended for more advanced automation tasks.
